# IncidentHub
The project resolves the issue of reporting, assigning and resolving production-like incidents.

# Reasoning
This is a proof of concept for a fullstack role where I simulate a production-like environment and use: 
- Backend: Java, Spring Boot 
- Messaging: Kafka
- Database: PostgreSQL 
- Containerization: Docker
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Frontend: React

Inside requirements.md, there are core ideas I implement and push inside GitHub repository:
- I make commits clearly and concise
- I use the feature branching strategy
- I pull requests to the main branch
- I generate comments based on what I have done so far and solve them accordingly
